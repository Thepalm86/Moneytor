- **Architecture**: Scalable, maintainable, and secure enterprise-grade codebase
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed, responsiveness, and seamless user interactions

## Implementation Best Practices Framework

**Best Practices Adherence**: Throughout the entire implementation process, all development must strictly follow industry best practices including:
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and maintainable code with proper TypeScript types, consistent naming conventions, and comprehensive documentation
- **Performance**: Optimization techniques including code splitting, lazy loading, caching strategies, and efficient database queries
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast standards
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing strategy with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing for critical user flows
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user-friendly error messages, graceful degradation, and proper logging
- **Documentation**: Clear, comprehensive documentation for code, APIs, and user-facing features

## Core Implementation Principles

**Critical Success Factors**: Every task and phase must ensure adherence to these fundamental principles:

### 1. **Alignment Across All Components**
- **Design Consistency**: All UI components must follow the established design system with consistent spacing, typography, colors, and interaction patterns
- **Code Architecture**: Maintain consistent code structure, naming conventions, and architectural patterns across all modules and components
- **Data Flow**: Ensure coherent data management patterns using the same state management approaches, API calling conventions, and data transformation methods
- **User Experience**: Maintain consistent navigation patterns, user workflows, and interaction behaviors throughout the entire application
- **Integration Harmony**: All third-party integrations (Supabase, UI libraries, charts) must work seamlessly together without conflicts or inconsistencies

### 2. **Attention to All Important Aspects**
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize performance continuously - consider loading times, bundle sizes, database queries, and user experience metrics
- **Accessibility**: Ensure every feature is accessible to all users - implement proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for all user interactions, API calls, and edge cases with meaningful user feedback
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data consistency, validation, and proper handling of edge cases in all database operations and user inputs
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Test and ensure functionality across all major browsers and devices
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure optimal experience across all screen sizes and device types
